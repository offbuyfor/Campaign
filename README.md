# CrowdCoin -  A Kickstarter Clone using Ethereum

CrowdCoin allows crowdsourcing funds for use in their projects. There are 2 different roles in this project

`Owner` - Creator of a project/campaign \
`Contributer/Approver` - One who contributed to a campaign and has an approving authority\

When an owner needs money to spend, he creates a request for the release of funds. Contributors can
approve requests and requests that are approved by more than half of contributors can then be finalized
by the owner to release the funds.
